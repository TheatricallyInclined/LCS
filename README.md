Basic desktop app that controls DMX based Lights

**User Story:**

I wish I could easily change the color of these LEDs

**Project Outline**

LCS or Lighting Controlled Simply is a C# desktop based application designed to be an easy to use replacement for two scene preset boards.  We are utilizing the open source USB to DMX converter from Enttec to help minimize cost and simplify user hardware complexity.  We are looking to deliver all the simplicity and function of a physical board while also having extra tools commonly found in high end boards in order to help the user.


**MVP Feature Set:**

1. Live computer control of DMX lights
2. Ability to control any type of DMX functionality including but not limited to Color (RGBCMY), Color Temperature, Intensity, Pan, Tilt, Gobo Selection, Gobo Rotation, FX, FX Speed, etc.
3. Have instant and timed transitions between at least 2 scenes


**Add on Features:**

1. Control multiple types of DMX Lights at once
2. Ability to Create timed Show files and a cue list
3. Ability to create light groups of similar but different addressed fixtures
4. Sound activated mode

**Running Software**

After downloading the zip and extracting from GitHub. Open the project folder and run the executable file found in the LCS folder or open LCS.sln file with Visual Studio and run it inside Visual Studio.
